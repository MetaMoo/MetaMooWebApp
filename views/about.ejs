	<p style="line-height: 175%"> MetaMoo is a tool that simplifies the way you read and record information.</p> 

	<p style="line-height: 175%"> MetaMoo was founded in 2014 by <strong>Vasanth Sarathy </strong> (cartoonist, lawyer and computer scientist) and <strong>Pete Spiegel </strong>(musician, educator and marketing-guru). They were tired of constantly having to search for things in their notes, documents and in websites they had bookmarked as being "useful". Word searches weren't doing the job well because they would remember the context of something, but not the exact words.</p>

	<p style="line-height: 175%"> With MetaMoo they were able to search for a thought and instantly see all their notes and highlights associated with that thought. It is just an easier way to take notes in a digital world.</p>

	<h1 style="font-family: Serif"> <strong>Why the name, MetaMoo? </strong></h1>

	<p style="line-height: 175%"> <strong> "Meta" </strong> because we believe the key to organizing your thinking in the face of overwhelming information is tracking your introspective thought process, ("Metacognition"). That is the "whys", "hows", "whats" we ask ourselves as we read and write things. Capturing these metacognitive thoughts with hashtags like #what, #conclusion etc., is a very powerful way of remember why you highlighted something or wrote something down. It also makes organizing stuff a piece of cake!</p>

	<p style="line-height: 175%">The <strong>"Moo"</strong> is 'cause we love cows. Did you know that they have epiphanies, just like us humans? So, obviously we picked a cow as our mascot because we believe MetaMoo helps people gain insights and epiphanies faster.
